# Notes about PSP (Programming Processes and Services)

## Notes about course development

Theory vs practice. The course is designed to be as much practical as possible. The theoretical concepts will be explained as needed. The practical content will be developed in the lab sessions.

Tasks. We will doing tasks (programming exercises). The tasks will be mostly individual but some of them may be done in pairs or small groups. The tasks will be evaluated and will contribute to the final grade. At this moment 30% of the final grade will be based on tasks.

### Exams

The exams will have a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part will be mostly multiple choice but could be short answers, etc. as required. The practical part will be a programming exercise to be done in the computer. The exams will be done in the computer lab. The final grade will be 70% based on the exams. The division between the theoretical and practical parts will be defined later and may vary depending on the contents of the units covered by set exam.

### AI

Due to the increasing use of AI tools (like ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) in programming, we will be allowing their use in the tasks (we can't prevent it) but will **not be allowed in the exams**. **Use of AI tools in the exams will be considered as cheating and will be penalized accordingly**.

However, the students must understand that they will be evaluated on their own knowledge and skills. Therefore, the students must be able to explain and justify the solutions they provide. The use of AI tools will be considered as a support tool, not as a substitute for learning.

The student may be asked to explain the code provided in the tasks or exams. If the student is not able to explain the code, the task or exame exercise will be considered as not passed (even if the code is correct).

## Contents

This is a work in progress. This is just an overview of the plans for the course. The contents may vary depending on the needs of the students and the time available.

We will try to cover the practical aspects with Go language but, if needed, we will be switching to Java (or Python). It's not decided yet.

### Unit 1: Introduction to concurrent programming

Programs, processes and threads. How to distinguish between sequential and concurrent programming. Context switching. Benefits and challenges of concurrent programming. CPU scheduling algorithms. Critical section problem, etc.

As practical content we will se the fundamentas of concurrent programming in Go.

### Unit 2: Programming with multiple processes

* Input output to processes. Redirection and pipes. Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms: shared memory, message queues, signals, sockets, etc.
* Process management: creation, termination, synchronization, etc.
* Introspection: obtaining information about processes, resources, etc.

### Unit 3: Programming with threads

* Creation and management of threads.
* Synchronization mechanisms: mutexes, semaphores, condition variables, etc.
* Producer consumer model.

### Unit 4: Sockets and network programming

* Protocols TCP IP.
* TCP sockets.
* UDP sockets.
* To be defined...

### Unit 5: Services

Using services (FTP, mail, etc.) from programs.

### Unit 6: Security

* Good practices for secure programming.
* Cryptography, hashing, certificates, etc.
* Secure sockets (SSL / TLS).
* To be defined...
