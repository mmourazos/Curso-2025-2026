# Welcome

I'm welcoming you to the course of English. My name is Manuel and I'll be your teacher.

I already made the presentation forum available and encourage you to use it so we can know each other better.

## Opening of the first unit

The first unit and the tutoring sessions will be available from September the 15th (Monday).

## Tutoring

This course includes two kind of tutoring sessions: Individual and collective. Individual tutoring sessions are for answering questions, one to one while the collective ones are open for all the students to ask and interact.

Although remote access is preferable you could come to the tutoring sessions in person. It would be appreciated if you give me advance notice you if chose to come in person.

### Tutoring schedule

* Individual tutoring: Friday mornings from 12:05 to 12:55.
* Collective tutoring: Tuesdays from 19:20 to 20:10.

### Link to collective tutoring sessions

**Important!:** To join the meeting you will need to use your google account from IES San Clemente (`@iessanclemente.net`).

We will always use the same link to join the collective tutoring sessions:
